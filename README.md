# Basic Scala API for Open AI compatible LLM api's

This is a simple API for Open AI's LLM API. 

It is not meant to be used in production, it is incomplete.

It is meant to be used for testing and learning purposes or as a starting point for your own system.

I recommend copy/pasting the code into your own project and modifying it to suit your needs.

Look in the `examples` directory for example usages. There are 2:

1. [A simple request response chat](examples/simple-chat/src/main/scala/com/github/merlijn/llm/examples/chat/Main.scala)
2. [A basic Telegram bot](examples/telegram-bot/src/main/scala/com/github/merlijn/llm/examples/telegram_bot/Main.scala)
